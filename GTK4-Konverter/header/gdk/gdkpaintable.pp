   * @snapshot: Snapshot the paintable. The given @width and @height are
   *   guaranteed to be larger than 0.0. The resulting snapshot must modify
   *   only the area in the rectangle from (0,0) to (width, height).
   *   This is the only function that must be implemented for this interface.
   * @get_current_image: return a `GdkPaintable` that does not change over
   *   time. This means the `GDK_PAINTABLE_STATIC_SIZE` and
   *   `GDK_PAINTABLE_STATIC_CONTENTS` flag are set.
   * @get_flags: Get the flags for this instance. See [enum@Gdk.PaintableFlags]
   *   for details.
   * @get_intrinsic_width: The preferred width for this object to be
   *   snapshot at or 0 if none. This is purely a hint. The object must still
   *   be able to render at any size.
   * @get_intrinsic_height: The preferred height for this object to be
   *   snapshot at or 0 if none. This is purely a hint. The object must still
   *   be able to render at any size.
   * @get_intrinsic_aspect_ratio: The preferred aspect ratio for this object
   *   or 0 if none. If both [vfunc@Gdk.Paintable.get_intrinsic_width]
   *   and [vfunc@Gdk.Paintable.get_intrinsic_height] return non-zero
   *   values, this function should return the aspect ratio computed from those.
   *
   * The list of functions that can be implemented for the `GdkPaintable`
   * interface.
   *
   * Note that apart from the [vfunc@Gdk.Paintable.snapshot] function,
   * no virtual function of this interface is mandatory to implement, though it
   * is a good idea to implement [vfunc@Gdk.Paintable.get_current_image]
   * for non-static paintables and [vfunc@Gdk.Paintable.get_flags] if the
   * image is not dynamic as the default implementation returns no flags and
   * that will make the implementation likely quite slow.
